## Current Project

### **House Price Prediction and Analysis**
- **Description**: This project integrates Machine Learning and data visualization to predict house prices and analyze key influencing factors. It highlights how machine learning models can uncover valuable insights in real estate data.
- **Key Insights**:
  - `Distance_to_MRT` is the most critical factor influencing house prices.
  - The Gradient Boosting model provided the best predictions with minimal error.
  - Residual analysis highlights areas of under/overprediction, enabling better understanding of model performance.
- **Folder Contents**:
  - `Data Folder`: Contains raw and processed datasets:
    - `Real_Estate.csv`: Raw data used for analysis.
    - `Processed_Real_Estate.csv`: Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
    - `Predictions.csv`: Contains actual vs. predicted house prices and residuals.
    - `Feature_Importances.csv`: Highlights the importance of each feature.
  - `Python Scripts`: Code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
  - `Tableau Workbook (.twbx)`: Visualizations of predictions and feature importance.
  - `Processed Data Visualization.pdf`: Key charts from Tableau.
  - `ReadMe.md`: Detailed description of the project.
